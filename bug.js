This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component that renders a child component conditionally.  The problem arises when the child component is unmounted, then remounted. The ref might still point to the old instance of the unmounted component, causing unexpected behavior or errors when you attempt to access its properties or methods. This is particularly problematic when interacting with native modules or components that have lifecycle events tied to them.

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const [showChild, setShowChild] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (ref.current) {
      console.log('Ref current:', ref.current);
      // Accessing ref.current here might throw an error if child component unmounted and remounted
    }
  }, [showChild]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Toggle Child" onPress={() => setShowChild(!showChild)} />
      {showChild && <ChildComponent ref={ref} />}
    </View>
  );
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Child component mounted');
    return () => console.log('Child component unmounted');
  }, []);

  return <Text>I'm a child component!</Text>;
}
```
